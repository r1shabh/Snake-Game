# Snake-Game
Python program that plays the game, snake.

# Overview
This program runs the famous nokia phone game, snake, but with a twist. The object of the game is still to gain the highest score possible by eating fruit and avoiding death from either running into the boundaries or into yourself. However, there are two "poison" fruits. The red fruit decreases the player's score by 10 points, and the white fruit increases the snake's size by 1 while keeping the score the same. The player must try and get the green fruit, which raises the score by 10 points while increasing the snake's size, while avoiding the 2 other fruits.

# How to run
This program is built using the pygame library, so you must have pygame installed on your computer in order to run. All the code is in the SnakeGame.py file. Simply run it, and the game will start. The other, supplemental files in this repository are sound effects, fonts, and images used for the game. You must have them in the same folder as your .py file in order to run. When you run it, you will first see an image of a snake, along with the text "hungry snake". After a few seconds, it will switch to a screen showing the rules of the game, along with instructions on how to start playing, and/or exit the program.
